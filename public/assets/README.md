# Marker Pattern Setup

## Creating Your Logo Marker

1. **Prepare your logo image:**
   - High contrast image (black and white works best)
   - Square format (512x512px recommended)
   - Clear, distinctive features
   - Avoid symmetrical designs

2. **Generate pattern file:**
   - Go to: https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html
   - Upload your logo image
   - Download the generated `.patt` file
   - Rename it to `pattern-logo.patt`
   - Place it in this `/assets` folder

3. **Alternative - Use default Hiro marker:**
   - Download: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.patt
   - Rename to `pattern-logo.patt`
   - Print the Hiro marker from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png

## Testing Your Marker

1. Print the marker image on paper
2. Start the AR app
3. Point camera at the printed marker
4. The 3D text should appear above the marker
5. Tap the text to visit www.demo.unreno.rocks

## Marker Requirements

- Good lighting conditions
- Stable camera position
- Marker should be flat and clearly visible
- Distance: 20cm - 2m from camera works best
